## What is this?

wiyu.dev is a website project. It's something I'll use as a blog of sorts, but also as a portfolio and a place to experiment with web designs; something I'd like to get better at.

I'm leaving the project open-source in case I find any cool effects which people would like to reproduce themselves, even if I don't expect to fall on anything very uncommon.
